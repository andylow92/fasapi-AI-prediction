We delved into the classic advertising problem, where the intricate dance between TV, newspaper, and radio ad spending unfolds its impact on sales figures. Armed with a comprehensive dataset, we embarked on a comparative analysis of several prominent models:

    Ridge Regression: Known for its resilience against outliers, this linear model strikes a balance between flexibility and stability using L2 regularization.
    Lasso Regression: Introducing feature selection with L1 regularization, Lasso offers potential interpretability at the cost of increased sensitivity to outliers.
    XGBoost: This powerhouse leverages gradient boosting to handle complex, non-linear relationships effectively, making it well-suited for feature correlation and data efficiency.
    Random Forest: Ensembling decision trees, Random Forest shines in capturing intricate interactions and handling limited data, albeit with less interpretability.
